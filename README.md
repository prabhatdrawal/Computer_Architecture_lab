The Computer Architecture Lab is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in understanding the internal organization, functioning, and performance aspects of modern computer systems. Through practical implementation of theoretical concepts, students will learn how computers execute instructions, manage memory, and optimize data flow.

# Objectives
- Understand fundamental components of a CPU (ALU, Control Unit, Registers, etc.)

- Explore instruction cycle and execution flow

- Design and simulate basic digital circuits

- Implement arithmetic and logical operations using Verilog

- Study pipelining, memory hierarchies, and caching mechanisms

- Analyze performance metrics and architectural trade-offs

# Lab Highlights
- Digital Logic Simulation: full adder and parallel adder

- ALU Design: Perform binary arithmetic and logic operations

- CPU Datapath Implementation: Single-cycle and pipelined CPU design using Verilog

- Instruction Set Simulation: Custom ISA execution using simulated memory

- Cache Design: Direct-mapped and associative cache behavior with trace analysis

- Pipeline Hazards: Forwarding, stalling, and hazard resolution techniques

# Tools & Technologies
- Verilog HDL / ModelSim / Vivado / GTKWave

- Python/C++ (for simulation tools)

- Raspberry Pi Pico (optional hardware integration)
